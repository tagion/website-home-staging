                            <p>Transactions on Tagion are validated in between two or three seconds, placing it on par with major credit card operators in terms of validation speed.</p>
                            <p>A fast validation time is reached through the use of Hashgraph for consensus and an efficient (Patent Pending) gossip Mechanism. The Hashgraph algorithm and the accompanying mathematical proof was initially discovered by Leemon Baird. </p>
                            <p>The algorithm ensures that all nodes, infinite time, reach the same order of events - as long as more than two-thirds of the nodes in the network follow the same consensus rules. In doing so, the nodes confirm and validate any action on the network, such as a money transfer, money exchange, or data interactions.</p>
                            <p>The gossip mechanisms optimise data exchange between nodes to happen most efficiently.</p>

                            <p>Most DLTs use a decentralised, immutable database for storage. The blockchain data structure is immutable, meaning all data should be stored forever. </p>
                            <p>Tagion uses a distributed database for storage, meaning a node only stores a part of the data. DART (Distributed Archive of Random Transactions) gives away with immutability, and only the output of a transaction is stored, while input and calculations are omitted, helping to reduce size. The innovation in terms of data utilisation is, however, that once a bill becomes irrelevant, it is deleted, rather than kept forever.</p>
                            <p>The mechanism transforms an exponential workload into a linear workload, which saves vast amounts of CPU power.</p>
