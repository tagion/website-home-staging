These principles are translated into a permissionless system where one node has one vote and only controls one node.

More, it is not required that the network is fully distributed to ensure the network is secure. The requirement is that it is distributed in a way where many actors control an insignificant amount of nodes avoiding centralisation of power like in other networks, where few nodes may have majority control.\nOne of the downsides of democracy is that all have the same voting power independent of contribution. Thus, the Tagion system has a scoring system that values loyalty that works through time but is still open and fair for all to participate.
