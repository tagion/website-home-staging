The model is based on Elinor Ostrom's ideas and design principles with (self-)governing of the commons. The overall perception of resource governance in today's society is between private or state ownership extremes. There is a third option called Commons, which can be translated to self-governance or community governance. Elinor Ostrom argues and proves, it is much more efficient when it comes to governing common resources. She won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2009 for her work within the field [7, 6]. We believe a monetary system and banking network should be a common resource because all users have an equal interest in the system; thus, the system should serve all interests equally by being governed as a common resource. Designing a governance model for a common requires clear rules for the system's boundaries, resources, and actors, which is described in this chapter.
