There are two main phases of economic governance; where the first is a linear and stable supply. The second phase builds on a model that aims to keep the intrinsic value of the currency stable by controlling the supply of money. The idea is that money reflects the underlying value of an asset; money in itself does not have value. Production in our society creates value: the assets, which values are represented by money, make them easy to trade. Being able to represent a value for the persons using the money needs to trust that they can use it elsewhere, and it needs to have a stable value over time. A currency is trusted because it has adoption and a stable value over time, not because it is backed by gold or state-backed. Adoption of the Tagion network happens over time, but the stability of the Tagion currency needs to be addressed, making it trusted.")]),e._v(" "),a("h2",{attrs:{id:"stable-supply"}},[a("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#stable-supply"}}),e._v(" Stable supply")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("Creating a stable supply with full transparency like in Bitcoin (though decreasing supply, stable) builds trust in the system. No actor can make a significant supply and dilute the value and the trust in the system. Some systems have a built-in cap, which needs to be changed programmatically, like Bitcoin. Tagion does not have a built-in cap because the supply of money should somehow correspond to the adoption, thus representing values in the system. Otherwise, destructive deflation in the system can cause the real use of the system to fall because people tend to hold and speculate with the money instead of using it. Of course, inflation can also be destructive, but a steady and in-significant increase in the supply of money should not create hyperinflation in the system. The most important thing would be that people keep using Tagions because they trust the money and do not hold on to them due to deflation. In the first couple of years in a monetary system's lifetime, high volatility is expected because of the low numbers of actors, which can easily both make the internal and external value go up and down because each actor's transaction can be significant in the system. As adoption occurs and the number of actors in the system becomes significant compared to a single actor, price volatility decreases because no single actor significantly affects the system.\nWhen this adoption is reached, it leads us to the next phase, where an algorithm controlling the money supply stabilizes the intrinsic value.")]),e._v(" "),a("h2",{attrs:{id:"stable-intrinsic-value"}},[a("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#stable-intrinsic-value"}}),e._v(" Stable intrinsic value")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("Milton Friedman stated that “Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon,” which means it has nothing to do with the production in society.
